		    			Tesla Motors was founded by a group of engineers in Silicon Valley who wanted to prove that electric cars could be better than gasoline-powered cars. With instant torque, incredible power, and zero emissions, Tesla&rsquo;s products would be cars without compromise. Our mission is to accelerate the world&rsquo;s transition to sustainable transport.<br>
			    		Tesla is not just an automaker, but also a technology and design company with a focus on energy innovation.
